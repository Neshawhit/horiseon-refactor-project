## Description

In this project I refactored HTML and CSS coding for better accesibility and organization within the code. Using neccessary tags to establish the navigation bar and the various sections using semantic elements. After defining sections within the html and adding proper tags; Neccessary adjustsments to the CSS code were made to match HTML restructor. Changing css styles to match HTML alterations ensured design and functionality of the page was unaltered. A few improvements and consolidations were made to the page's design as well to make the code more legible, all while maintaining the original design of the client.
